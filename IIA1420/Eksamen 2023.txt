1.
a) (V) Principal component analysis is not ML?
b) (V) Artificial Neural Network is an ML method since it trains a model based on data. 
In its case, it trains the parameters and weights of each node based on the data given.
c) (V/X) A Kalman Filter is not a machine learning method because it doesn't learn from data, 
but must be tweeked by a human to become better
d) (X) Newton-Rapson is an ML method because the numerical optimization method is trained using data 
gathered and then can predict the optimized solution later.
e) (V) Decision trees are ML methods because they are trained by data. Specifically the limits for each
choise inside the trees are found through training on data.
f) (V) Alphabetical sorting is not an ML method because it is a strict set of rules which do not change
and are not trained for better results.
g) (V/X?) Navigation and path finding are normally done by specifying possible paths and using strict rules
to choose the best path. However, there are some path planning algorithms using ML which are mostly 
usefull when looking at an overwhelming amount of choises.

2.
a) (V) Hyperparameters are the parameters used by a ML algorithm which must be determined beforehand, by 
the user, for the algorithm to work. This can be the number of clusters in an unsupervised clustering
method like k-mean, or the number of layers in a Neural Network.
b) (V) How to choose good hyperparameters depends on the dataset, but good practice is to analyse the 
dataset in multiple ways and visualise the effect of the parameter on the predictions. You can also 
try different tuning methods, like the brute force method of trying all possible values and finding
the best one or some variant of smarter choise selection. 
c) (V) To make sure the model is trained, tested and validated by three separate groups of data, the 
complete dataset should be split into three unik groups with no overlap. The training data is the most
important group and should be the larges. Then the testing and validation set could be around the same 
size as each other, or the test group could be a little larger. A normal ratio is somewhere around an
80/20 split between train/validation and test and another 80/20 splitt between the training and 
validation group. However, the point is to make sure the variance and accuracy of the model 
predictions are good. This splitting ration is refered to as the Pareto principle.

3.
a) (V/X) b is the bias of the layer, a constant. w is the list of weights of the datapoints sent to the 
neuron. x is the list of datapoints sent in to the neuron. y is the predicted result, and f is the 
function or topology of the neuron which decides what the neuron is focusing on.
b) (V) Neurons can be connected together into a fully connected feed forward NN by organizing them in 
layers and giving the outputs of one layer as inputs to the next layer. Mathmatically, this would look 
like functions working on matrixes multiplied together, where one functions results are the next 
functions inputs. 
c) (V) Feed-Forward NN, Recurrent NN and Convolutional NN.
Feed forward is the simplest method where information is sendt from one layer to the next in a single 
direction. It works best when data is independant and not corrolated with eachother. Examples are 
regression and classification where there is no need to learn from earlier predictions.
Recurrent is a twist where the neural network contains cycles making the layer outputs bidirectional.
This means the information calculated by a layer can be used in a previous layer and data can be stored
for later use. This is usefull when using Neural networks for solving problems following a series, like
the stock market or the weather.  
Convolutional are feed forward neural networks with feature extraction at more and more complex levels, 
buildt with image and language recognition in mind.
d) (V) Transfer learning is the consept of using a prevoisly trained model on a new but similare problem. 
This allows the model to bring previously thought experiences to the new problem and allow for a much 
faster training, or the solving of a problem without a large pool of data.

4.
a) (V) Precision = TP / TP + FP = 35 / (35 + 65) = 35 / 100 = 0.350
The precision is the fraction of correct positive predictions
b) (V) Recall = TP / TP + FN = 35 / (35 + 15) = 35 / 50 = 0.70
The recall is the fraction of actually positive cases that are correctly predicted
c) (V) F1 score = 2 * Precision * Recall / (Precision + Recall) = 2 * 0.35 * 0.7 / (0.35 + 0.7) = 0.467
F1 score is a constructed measurement taking into account both the precision and recall
d) (V) Accuracy = TN + TP / ALL = (885 + 35) / (885 + 35 + 15 + 65) = 920 / 1000 = 0.920
The accuracy is the fraction of correct predictions

5.
a) (X) Always less than parent beacuse we are splitting of instances
b) (X) When overfitting, scaling could reduce the variance and allow for more controlled prediction even
when overfitted. This makes it a good idea.

6.
a) (V) In an SVM, gamma regulates the influnce of a single training example. Increasing it gives a larger 
influnce and can help with underfitting by allowing a more complex model. 
b) (V) C controls the regularisation of the classification. Increasing the value makes the model allow for 
fewer misclassifiactions and could make the training more effective. 

7.
a) (V) Clustering is asigning datapoints to groups based on some similare characteristics. Clustering metods 
aim to predict which group a datapoint belongs to by a trained set of thresholds.
b) (V) Clustering algorithms can be used for classification problems like identifying spam emails or fraud
bank transactions, object recognision or pattern recognision.
c) (X) To select the right number of clusters, you could visualise the data and look for possible obvious 
clusters, or you could do a Newtonian iteration for each cluster number and evaluate the spread of the
clusters to determine the best fit. The specific case might also be important in determining the number
of clusters.

8.
a) (V/X) Pressure can be detected in multiple ways, but mechanical movement of metal parts connected to the 
pipe, or changes in electrical voltage or capacity are the most common. A transmitting pressure 
detector can be placed anywhere on the pipe as long as the volume is unchanged, as the pressure is 
constant.
b) (V/X) Before use, the sensor must be calibrated according to the local pressure and its own fluctuations. 
Then the Sensor must be calibrated with the normal flow pressure and its variations.
c) (V) Sudden drops in pressure cold indicate a leak, or a gradual decrease in the mean value could be a 
sign.
d) (V/X) A recurrsive NN which could be a good model as it works best on timeseries problems and can work in
realtime, instead of using bulks of data, when it needs to identify changes based on past data.
e) (V) Since leaks are not normally occuring and would be costly or hard to induce by choise, the dataset
would be heavily favouring the normal state and if the to datagroups are made similare in size, the 
total dataset could be problematically small.

9.
a) (V) You want to use lasso regression instead of ridge when you have few important features in your 
dataset as it is better at removing unimportant features from the estimation process.
b) (V) Sometimes lasso regression becomes to scewed towards a single feature, and in these cases, elastic 
net as a middleway between ridge and lasso can be better.

10.
a) (V) Aliasing is a problem where a signal is sampled at different intervals could be indistiguisable from
a different signal based on the frequency, this normally happens when samples are taken with to long of
an interval.
b) (X) 15 Hz |Correct is 2x30 = 60 Hz

11. (V/X) Since a linear dipendance upon the temperature is the relation you want, you can see that 
Thermistors have a low temperature working range and they are very sensitive to changes. RTDs have a 
much higher working range, and are also quite sensitive. Finally, the Thermocouple is very insensitive
to temperature changes, but it can be used at both low, medium and high temperatures. However, when used
at a different working range, it must be tuned again.

12.
a) (V) All three types of pressure are comparisons of pressure between a medium and something else. 
Absolute pressure is a mediums pressure compared with a vacuum. Gauge pressure is compared to the 
atmosphere. Differential pressure is compared to another medium.
b) (X) A subscript of either abs, diff or gau? Don't know. |Correct is parenthesis with first letter.

13.
a) (V) The principle of the electromagnetic flow meter is to induce a current in a closed loop based on the 
amount of liquid flowing through the pipe.
Three addvantage of this type are no moving parts, so low maintenance, it is not effencted by particles 
in the liquid, and it is independant of the liquids pressure, temperature of viscosity.
Three disadvantages are that the medium must be conductive, the sensor must be interacting with the 
liquid, making it harder to install, and deposits inside the pipe could make it less accurate.
b) (X) A vortex flow sensor is consists of a freemoving vortex spun around by the moving liquid inside the
pipe. It has the advantages of being very precise, one directional, maening it can hinder errorus flow,
and its cheap. However, it consists of moving parts which could break more easily, it it must be 
installed inside the pipe, and it interacts directly with the liquid, making it flow more slowly.

m = rho * A * (H - h)
m = 1000 * 2.0 * (2.0 - 1.0) = 2000 * 1.0 = 2000
RSS = sqrt((u_rho * dm/drho)^2 + (u_A * dm/dA)^2 + (u_h * dm/dh)^2)
RSS = sqrt((10 * 2.0 * 1.0)^2 + (0.01 * 1000 * 1.0)^2 + (0.01 * -1.0 * 1000 * 2.0)^2)
RSS = sqrt((20)^2 + (10)^2 + (-20)^2)
RSS = sqrt(400 + 100 + 400) = sqrt(900) = 30
