1. Problem
- Starship needs to be fueld many times when going to Mars before it can leave
- Filling liquid fuel automatically to a Starship rocket in orbit around the Earth.

2. Context and Surroundings
- Space is empty of air
- Orbit has no gravitation, the fuel will be weightless
- The fuel must be transportet between one rocket and another, either directly or indirectly.
o The system must be able to dock to a rocket.
o Fuel must be extracted from one tank and injected into another.
o The system must be able to determine when a tank is empty and not.

3. Alternative Designs
- A permanent station in space with two docking spots, which navigates to a rocket and extracts fuel at one end and injects it into a temperary tank, before injecting it
into another ship at the other dock.
- A tube capable of docking to another ship fastened on fueling ship. Like male and female counterparts. The tube seeks out the other ship's tank and atatches itself to
the docking hole, before transfering the fuel

- Mechanical pump inside the tank either sucking the pushing fuel via pressure
- A fanbased pump sucking or pushing fuel
- Magnetic field set on the tank pushing the fuel out. (Only viable if ful is magnetic, not clear)

- Optical vision for locating rocket and where to move to
- IR vision
- Radio vision

4. The Solution
To make the solution more robust in the future, a permanent station with two dockingstations was choosen. The station has a mechanical pump inside the tank,
an optical sensor for finding the rockets and a small set of engins for propelling the station to a rocket.
